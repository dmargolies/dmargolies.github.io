To expand my full stack knowledge I joined a startup in 2022, but I was caught up in the layoff wave of 2023. Now I'm beefing up my skills on the front end and back end, networking, and looking for my next full time role. Check out my <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/dmargolies'>github</a>."

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: "<p class='lead'>
    In my career, as in life, I'm always learning. I started my career as a consultant at IBM, moved over to software engineering and became a front-end expert, eventually rebuilding a legacy JS application in React. From there, I moved into FinTech, worked as a Principal Engineer, and even led a team of 8 engineers in the US and Mexico. I even flew down to Guadalajara on my own dime to meet the team.
    </p>
    <p class='lead'>
    My expertise lies with front end web development, but my interest extends up the stack. I have experience building GraphQL APIs in Java Spring, and with AWS services such as SQS and S3. There's just so much to do in the technology space and I'm excited to learn whatever comes next.
